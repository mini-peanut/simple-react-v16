 *
 * There is no guarantee that calls to `setState` will run synchronously,

 * callback that will be executed when the call to setState is actually
 * completed.
 *
 * When a function is provided to setState, it will be called at some point in
 * the future (not synchronously). It will be called with the up to date
 * component arguments (state, props, context). These values can be different
 * from this.* because your function may be called after receiveProps but before
 * shouldComponentUpdate, and this new state, props, and context will not yet be
 * assigned to this.

 * @param {object|function} partialState Next partial state or function to

 * @param {?function} callback Called after state is updated.
